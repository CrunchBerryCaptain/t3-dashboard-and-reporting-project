## Recommendations for T3 (Preliminary)

### Cutting costs
It might be worth considering decommissioning 'Hartmann's Jellied Eels', as it is making significantly less money than the other trucks. The profit might not outweigh the running costs.

### Exploring high-performing cuisine
Burrito Madness is doing exceptionally well. T3 should consider more mexican-style food trucks as this cuisine seems to be making a lot of revenue given the locations its operating in.


### Improving existing trucks
SuperSmoothie seems to be underperforming the rest of the food trucks (besides the Jellied Eels) by a noticeable margin. This may be due to the fact that it only takes cash payments (as it does not have a card register), potentially missing customers who don't carry cash with them.

I suggest investing into a card reader for this truck. I believe that the profit gain from reaching card-only customers would outweigh the cost of implementation.
